                <p>The Crab Nebula, first observed in Earthâ€™s sky in 1054 A.D., remains a fascinating subject of study due to its powerful neutron star core, which was formed by the collapse of a massive star. This nebula is characterized by its energetic jets of matter and anti-matter emanating from its poles and winds extending outward from its equator. Modern sonification of this data translates various wavelengths of light into different instrument families to capture the nebula's complexity.</p>

                <p>In this sonification, each type of light is represented by a different group of instruments: X-rays from Chandra (blue and white) are portrayed with brass instruments, optical light data from Hubble (purple) are represented by strings, and infrared data from Spitzer (pink) are played by woodwinds. The pitch is mapped based on vertical position in the image, with higher pitches corresponding to light towards the top. Brightness in the image affects the volume, creating a rich, multi-instrumental auditory experience of the Crab Nebula.</p>
