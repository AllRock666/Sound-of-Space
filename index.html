								<h1>Experience the music of the cosmos—where the silence of space meets the symphony of stars.</h1>
								<p>
									Have you ever imagined the music of the cosmos? While telescopes like Hubble reveal the universe through breathtaking images, there's another way to experience these celestial wonders—through sound. Using data sonification, the same data that creates stunning visuals is transformed into immersive soundscapes.

By assigning pitches and volumes to elements such as brightness and position, we bring the silent beauty of space to life. Although sound doesn't travel in the vacuum of space, sonification offers a unique way to explore and understand astronomical data. This approach also opens up the wonders of the universe to everyone, including those in the blind and visually impaired communities, allowing them to 'listen' to the stars and beyond.

										<h2>The Mice Galaxies</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>The Mice Galaxies, a colliding pair about 300 million light-years away in Coma Berenices, will eventually merge. In the data sonification, brightness is mapped to volume and pitch – brighter light is louder and lower pitched. The vertical position of objects affects the pitch of sustained strings, while cymbals swell with galaxy core brightness. Listen for a cymbal crash for the foreground star with diffraction spikes!</p>

											<p>This sonification represents a pair of interacting galaxies: the barred spiral galaxy NGC 275 and the lenticular galaxy NGC 274. Blue corresponds to higher pitch, red to lower. Larger and brighter objects produce lower, louder sounds, mapping both color and brightness to pitch and volume.</p>

										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification captures two Hubble images of the star V838 Monocerotis, taken nearly seven months apart in 2002. A pulse of light from the star illuminates the surrounding dust and gas. The brightness is mapped to pitch and volume, with the sound radiating outward from the center of each image, reflecting the evolving light echoes. Surrounding stars are translated into musical notes.

										<div class="content">
											<p>RS Puppis, a massive star 200 times the size of the Sun, is 6,500 light-years away and surrounded by dust reflecting its rhythmic light pulses. In this sonification, pitch is based on direction: higher notes from the top, lower from the bottom. Sound pans between speakers, with left light heard in the left speaker and right light in the right. Brighter light produces louder sound, offering a festive auditory experience of this star's six-week brightness cycle.</p>

										<h2>Black Hole at the Center of Galaxy M87</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification of Messier 87 (M87) captures data around the 2019 Event Horizon Telescope breakthrough. It visualizes the jet from the black hole using X-rays (Chandra), visible light (Hubble), and radio waves (Atacama Array). As sound pans left to right, radio waves are the lowest tones, visible light the mid-tones, and X-rays the highest. The brightest region, where the 6.5-billion-solar-mass black hole resides, is the loudest.</p>

										<h2>Butterfly Nebula</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification of the Butterfly Nebula turns its vibrant colors into sound. As it scans left to right, higher light produces higher pitches. The nebula’s gases are represented by strings and synthetic tones, while stars are played by a digital harp. Volume increases with brightness, and the nebula’s hourglass shape creates a rising sound, with a quick pitch rise at the iron-rich jet near the center.</p>

										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification captures a young star cluster 20,000 light-years away. Hubble data (green/blue) reveals star-forming clouds, while Chandra's X-rays (purple) penetrate the haze. As sound moves left to right, brighter light gets louder, and pitch reflects vertical position. Plucked strings represent stars, bowed strings for clouds, and bells for X-rays.</p>

										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification of the Cat’s Eye Nebula translates the outbursts of a dying star into sound. A clockwise scan reveals concentric bubbles with higher pitches for light farther from the center and brightness controlling volume. X-rays produce harsher tones, while visible light creates smoother sounds. The nebula’s rings produce a steady hum, with rising and falling tones as the scan moves across the star’s expelled shells and jets.</p>

											<p>This sonification of the Bullet Cluster shows the first direct evidence of dark matter. As sound pans left to right, dark matter (blue) is at the lowest frequencies, X-rays (pink) at the highest, and galaxies in the mid-range. Pitch increases from bottom to top within each layer, reflecting the separation of dark and normal matter during the galaxy cluster collision.</p>

											<p>This sonification of the Crab Nebula captures the remnants of a supernova from 1054 A.D., powered by a rapidly spinning neutron star. As the sound pans left to right, different wavelengths are paired with distinct instrument families: X-rays (blue and white) are represented by brass, optical light (purple) by strings, and infrared (pink) by woodwinds. Higher-pitched notes correspond to light at the top of the image, while brightness increases volume, translating the nebula's jets and winds into a symphony of sound.</p>

											<p>This sonification of the Eagle Nebula’s "Pillars of Creation" translates star-forming regions into sound. The towers of gas and dust, stretching 4 to 5 light-years, are sonified as sound moves left to right. Pitch is determined by the vertical position of light in the image. The iconic structure of the pillars is reflected as sweeping tones that rise and fall, emphasizing their shape. Both visible and X-ray data are incorporated, offering a sonic journey through this birthplace of stars.</p>

										<h2>Milky Way Center</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification of the Milky Way's galactic center captures the bustling activity around a 4-million-solar-mass black hole. Combining data from Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer, the sound scans from left to right. Higher-pitched tones represent light at the top of the image, and volume increases with brightness. Stars and compact sources are heard as individual notes, while gas and dust clouds form a continuous drone. A crescendo occurs at the lower right, where the supermassive black hole and the brightest gas clouds reside, marking the intense activity near the core.</p>
