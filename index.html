								<h1>Experience the music of the cosmos—where the silence of space meets the symphony of stars.</h1>
								<p>
									Have you ever imagined the music of the cosmos? While telescopes like Hubble reveal the universe through breathtaking images, there's another way to experience these celestial wonders—through sound. Using data sonification, the same data that creates stunning visuals is transformed into immersive soundscapes.

By assigning pitches and volumes to elements such as brightness and position, we bring the silent beauty of space to life. Although sound doesn't travel in the vacuum of space, sonification offers a unique way to explore and understand astronomical data. This approach also opens up the wonders of the universe to everyone, including those in the blind and visually impaired communities, allowing them to 'listen' to the stars and beyond.

										<h2>The Mice Galaxies</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>The Mice Galaxies, a colliding pair about 300 million light-years away in Coma Berenices, will eventually merge. In the data sonification, brightness is mapped to volume and pitch – brighter light is louder and lower pitched. The vertical position of objects affects the pitch of sustained strings, while cymbals swell with galaxy core brightness. Listen for a cymbal crash for the foreground star with diffraction spikes!</p>

											<p>This sonification represents a pair of interacting galaxies: the barred spiral galaxy NGC 275 and the lenticular galaxy NGC 274. Blue corresponds to higher pitch, red to lower. Larger and brighter objects produce lower, louder sounds, mapping both color and brightness to pitch and volume.</p>

										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification captures two Hubble images of the star V838 Monocerotis, taken nearly seven months apart in 2002. A pulse of light from the star illuminates the surrounding dust and gas. The brightness is mapped to pitch and volume, with the sound radiating outward from the center of each image, reflecting the evolving light echoes. Surrounding stars are translated into musical notes.

											<p>RS Puppis, a massive star 200 times the size of the Sun, is 6,500 light-years away and surrounded by dust reflecting its rhythmic light pulses. In this sonification, pitch is based on direction: higher notes from the top, lower from the bottom. Sound pans between speakers, with left light heard in the left speaker and right light in the right. Brighter light produces louder sound, offering a festive auditory experience of this star's six-week brightness cycle.</p>

										<h2>Black Hole at the Center of Galaxy M87</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification captures data from telescopes observing the black hole in Messier 87 (M87) around the time of the 2019 Event Horizon Telescope breakthrough. It visualizes the jet emerging from the black hole, using X-rays (Chandra), visible light (Hubble), and radio waves (Atacama Array). As the sonification scans from left to right, radio waves are mapped to the lowest tones, visible light to medium tones, and X-rays to the highest tones. The brightest part, where the 6.5-billion solar mass black hole is located, corresponds to the loudest sound.</p>

										<h2>Butterfly Nebula</h2>

											<p>This sonification of the Butterfly Nebula translates the colorful spectacle of a dying star into sound. Scanning from left to right, pitch corresponds to vertical position, with higher light producing higher-pitched tones. The nebula's gases are sonified using strings and synthetic tones, while stars are represented by a digital harp. Volume increases with brightness, and the nebula's hourglass shape results in a rising sound motion, with the iron-rich jet near the center creating a quick pitch rise.</p>

										<h2>Westerlund 2</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>This is a cluster of young stars – about one to two million years old – located about 20,000 light-years from Earth. In its visual image form, data from Hubble (green and blue) reveals thick clouds where stars are forming, while X-rays seen by Chandra (purple) penetrate through that haze. In the sonified version of this data, sounds sweep from left to right across the field of view with brighter light producing louder sound. The pitch of the notes indicates the vertical position of the sources in the image with the higher pitches towards the top of the image. The Hubble data is played by strings, either plucked for individual stars or bowed for diffuse clouds. Chandra’s X-ray data is represented by bells, and the more diffuse X-ray light is played by more sustained tones.</p>

										<h2>NGC 6543 (Cat's Eye Nebula)</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification of the Cat’s Eye Nebula reveals the outbursts of gas and dust from a dying star. X-rays from Chandra (center) and visible light from Hubble show concentric bubbles created by the star. The sound is produced by a clockwise radar-like scan. Higher pitches correspond to light farther from the center, and brightness is mapped to volume. X-rays generate harsher tones, while visible light produces smoother sounds. The nebula’s circular rings create a steady hum, punctuated by rising and falling tones as the scan moves across the shells and jets expelled by the star.</p>

										<h2>Bullet Cluster</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>This sonification of the Bullet Cluster highlights the first direct evidence of dark matter. X-rays (pink) show normal matter, while dark matter (blue) is revealed by visible light data from Hubble and ground-based telescopes. As sound pans from left to right, dark matter is assigned the lowest frequencies, X-rays the highest, and galaxies are in the mid-range. Within each layer, pitch increases from bottom to top, with objects higher in the image producing higher tones. This captures the separation of dark and normal matter during the collision of two galaxy clusters.</p>

										<h2>Crab Nebula</h2>

											<p>This sonification of the Crab Nebula captures the remnants of a supernova from 1054 A.D., powered by a rapidly spinning neutron star. As the sound pans left to right, different wavelengths are paired with distinct instrument families: X-rays (blue and white) are represented by brass, optical light (purple) by strings, and infrared (pink) by woodwinds. Higher-pitched notes correspond to light at the top of the image, while brightness increases volume, translating the nebula's jets and winds into a symphony of sound.</p>

										<h2>The Iconic Pillars of Creation</h2>

											<p>This sonification of the Eagle Nebula’s "Pillars of Creation" translates star-forming regions into sound. The towers of gas and dust, stretching 4 to 5 light-years, are sonified as sound moves left to right. Pitch is determined by the vertical position of light in the image. The iconic structure of the pillars is reflected as sweeping tones that rise and fall, emphasizing their shape. Both visible and X-ray data are incorporated, offering a sonic journey through this birthplace of stars.</p>

											<p>This sonification of the Milky Way's galactic center captures the bustling activity around a 4-million-solar-mass black hole. Combining data from Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer, the sound scans from left to right. Higher-pitched tones represent light at the top of the image, and volume increases with brightness. Stars and compact sources are heard as individual notes, while gas and dust clouds form a continuous drone. A crescendo occurs at the lower right, where the supermassive black hole and the brightest gas clouds reside, marking the intense activity near the core.</p>
